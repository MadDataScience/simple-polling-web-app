## A simple polling web application

This is the source code for a simple web polling application built using [Go](https://golang.org/), [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html), and HTML (no JavaScript!)

### What you can do

#### As a Poll Administrator:

- sign up for the website using an email address and password
  - **N.B.** This site is not secure, so do _not_ use a password you would mind being published on a public website. I recommend something simple like `123`.
- create polls
- edit polls
- view poll results
